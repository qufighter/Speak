	<br/><br/>Great!  You got this far.  On a standard webpage select some text, then click the icon to have it "read" to you.  You won't have to move your eyeballs so much...
	
	<br/><br/> ms means milisecond, which is 1/1000 th of a second.  This means that 1000 is one second, 500 is a half second, 250 is a quarter second, 125 is an eighth of a second, 62 is a sixteenth of a second.  The default is 55.
	<br/><br/> WPM is calculated based on the selected block of text, which varries.  If you configure a per letter delay the WPM will vary based on the text that is selected.  To always compute based on the same text configure the WPM Computation Text option, which is used for computation when no text is selected.

	<br/><br/> Clear Screen Duration - the amoutn of time the display goes blank between words, this helps distinguish between words (especially short words mixed into long ones)...  the clear duration cuts into the per word delay time, so make sure to adjust appropriately!
	<br/><br/>This software is beta and is provided as is, please provide feedback for improvements at <a href="http://www.vidzbigger.com/index.php?v=contact">vidzbigger.com/contact</a>  Thanks!
